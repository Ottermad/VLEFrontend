# VLE Frontend
This is the frontend of the VLE frontend built using React/Redux and is compiled with Webpack and yarn

## Requirements
The only neccessary dependancy is yarn, as this is used to install everything else

**With npm**
```
npm i -g yarn
```
**MacOS/Homebrew**
```
brew update
brew install yarn
```

### To build
Make sure dependencies are installed
```
yarn
```
or
```
yarn install
```

Then you can run the webserver or just build the files *note: Launching the webserver automatically builds the files*

**To run the webserver**
```
yarn start
```

**To build**
```
yarn run build
```
